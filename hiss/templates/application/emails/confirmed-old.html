      <br />
      <br />
      <!---
      <strong> Discord </strong> <br />
      HowdyHack will be a hybrid event, meaning we‚Äôll have participants in-person and virtually. We‚Äôll be using Discord both as our main communication platform for virtual hackers, and as a secondary communication platform for in-person hackers. 
      Join the Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/e3fDwp2" style="color: #00add8">discord.gg/e3fDwp2</a>) and we will announce on there when virtual check-in opens for access to all the channels for the event. 
      <br />
      Note: Virtual check-in does not mean you'll be participating in person. You'll still need to show up to the MSC before 200 people arrive on Saturday. 
      <br />

      <strong> Building Hours </strong> <br />
      TAMUhack is a 24-Hour event, so everyone is welcome to stay in the MSC throughout the entire event. However, please keep in mind that after midnight on Saturday, the doors to MSC will lock. You‚Äôre welcome to leave at any time, but if you leave after midnight, you won‚Äôt be able to re-access the building until 7am on Sunday. 
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong> In-Person Capacity </strong> <br />
      <strong style="color: #ed768b;">Due to building capacity restrictions, we‚Äôll only be able to admit 500 hackers in-person at TAMUhack. </strong> 
      Therefore, in-person attendance will be conducted on a first-come-first-served basis. 
      The first 500 people to show up to MSC Bethancourt Ballroom will be allowed to hack in person. 
      Our other hackers will be asked to participate virtually. Please come as early as you 
      can to secure an in-person spot at TAMUhack.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong> What To Bring </strong> <br />
      TAMUhack is a 24-Hour event, so we‚Äôd highly recommend bringing the following items to make sure you‚Äôre comfortable and productive!<br />

      </ul>
      <br />
      <strong> How Do Teams Work? </strong> <br />
      If you haven‚Äôt formed a team by Saturday, no worries! We‚Äôll have a team matching event before hacking starts where you‚Äôll be able to meet other hackers and join a team that fits your goals. 
      The maximum team size is 4 people, but you‚Äôre welcome to work solo or in teams of 2 or 3. However, we highly recommend joining a team. It‚Äôs a great way to make new friends and to keep you motivated throughout the event! 
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong> What Can I Build? </strong> <br />
      Feel free to build anything that interests you! If you can‚Äôt think of anything we‚Äôll have special prize categories in addition to the ‚Äúbuild anything‚Äù prompt, like ‚Äúbest musical hack‚Äù, to help you get started.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong> How do I get help during the Hackathon? </strong> <br />
      If you need some help ideating or getting your project started, we‚Äôll have mentors floating around the room throughout the hackathon. They're here to help you, so don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for help!
      <br />

      You‚Äôre allowed to work on your project from 12:00 pm on Saturday to 12:00 pm on Sunday. You‚Äôre welcome to ideate beforehand, but please do not work on your project at other times to avoid being disqualified from judging.
      <br />
